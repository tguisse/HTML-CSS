Galifianakis played Alan Garner in the hit comedy The Hangover and earned <br>
the MTV Movie Award for the Best Comedic Performance.[22] He was also prominently <br>
advertised in subsequent films that featured him in supporting roles, such as G-Force, <br>
Youth in Revolt and the Oscar-nominated film Up in the Air.<br>

Galifianakis also starred in the HBO series Bored to Death and hosted Saturday Night <br>
Live on March 6, 2010 during the show's 35th season, during which he shaved his beard <br>
mid-show for a sketch, and then closed the show wearing a fake beard.[23] He hosted again <br>
on March 12, 2011 and shaved his head this time, in a Mr. T-like hairstyle, which was <br>
allegedly supposed to be used for a sketch that never aired due to time constraints.[24]<br>

In 2010, he starred in several films, including Dinner for Schmucks, It's Kind of a Funny <br>
Story and Due Date.[25] On October 29, 2010, while debating marijuana legalization on the <br>
show HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher, Galifianakis appeared to have smoked marijuana on <br>
live television;[26] host Bill Maher denied that it was real marijuana in an interview with <br>
Wolf Blitzer during an episode of The Situation Room. In 2011, he returned as Alan Garner<br>
in the sequel, The Hangover Part II, which was set in Thailand[27] and voiced Humpty Dumpty<br>
in Puss in Boots. Galifianakis starred alongside Will Ferrell in Jay Roach's 2012 political <br>
comedy The Campaign.[28] He received critical praise for his performance in the 2014 film <br>
Birdman, in which he starred with Michael Keaton, Emma Stone and Edward Norton.<br>

In January 2014, it was announced that Galifianakis and Louis C.K. were developing a <br>
comedy pilot for FX.[29] In August 2015, Galifianakis is in final negotiations to play <br>
The Joker in Lego Batman.
